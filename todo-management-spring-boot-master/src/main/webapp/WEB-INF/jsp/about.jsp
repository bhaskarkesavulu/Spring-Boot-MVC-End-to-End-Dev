	<p>CRM (customer relationship management) is an information
		industry term for methodologies, software, and usually Internet
		capabilities that help an enterprise manage customer relationships in
		an organized way. For example, an enterprise might build a database
		about its customers that described relationships in sufficient detail
		so that management, salespeople, people providing service, and perhaps
		the customer directly could access information, match customer needs
		with product plans and offerings, remind customers of service
		requirements, know what other products a customer had purchased, and
		so forth.</p>
